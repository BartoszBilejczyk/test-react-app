# Workspace Dashboard Transformation - README

## Overview

Successfully transformed the React application from a marketing landing page to a functional workspace dashboard inspired by the ElevenLabs Creative Platform interface. This transformation completely changes the app's direction from promotional content to a personalized, tool-focused workspace environment.

## What Was Implemented

### 2. New Components Created
