# 📘 Project Context: Voice‑Enabled Tour of Features

## 🎯 Purpose

This application is being created to help a frontend developer — highly experienced in Vue — demonstrate deep understanding of React and prepare for a technical challenge in a recruitment process at **ElevenLabs**, a company specializing in voice AI.

The app is both a learning vehicle and a practical showcase of:

- Component-driven development in React
- Routing and state management using idiomatic React tools
- Clean UI built with Tailwind
- Audio-focused interactions relevant to ElevenLabs’ domain

## 🧑‍💻 Target Developer

The developer:

- Is **senior-level** and fluent in Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Needs to **translate their mental model** into idiomatic React patterns
- Will use this project to **demonstrate capability** with React Hooks, Context API, routing, and reusable components

## 🏢 Relevance to ElevenLabs

ElevenLabs is a voice AI company offering:

- Text-to-speech, dubbing, and voice cloning
- Use cases in narration, voiceover, and content generation

The app simulates a **guided feature tour**, similar to how a user might explore ElevenLabs' platform:

- Each route represents a product feature (e.g., Dubbing, Cloning, Projects, Scribe)
- Each page offers **voice samples and content descriptions**
- Playback is globally controlled, resembling how real user sessions would behave on a voice platform

## 🧪 Development Flow

The project is split into **8 clear phases**, each resulting in a fully working part of the app. Each phase is documented in a `README_phase_X.md` file that will also serve as **learning documentation** for how the React implementation maps to Vue concepts.

## 📂 Deliverables

- Full working React app
- Tailwind-styled, mobile-responsive layout
- Mock API for simulating data
- Global audio state via Context API
- Reusable components for clean separation
- 8-phase development process with documentation

## 📝 Evaluation

This project should demonstrate the developer’s ability to:

- Architect a maintainable frontend application
- Translate advanced Vue patterns into idiomatic React
- Build apps with real UX considerations (not toy examples)
- Align closely with the product and interaction patterns of ElevenLabs

Implement prettier and run prettier on the whole app.

Then, it looks like you completely, completely missed that for each component and page I wanted documentation how it works, how it maps to Vue and some inline comments so that I know how it would be done in Vue (concepts, not full code)
